# Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera

This are my notes on the course about octave.

For the installation I went to the [GNU Octave website](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and installed the lattest versiont that **isn't** 4.0.0.

I'm currently using Octave 3.8.0 with the experimental GUI downloaded and installed following the course instructions [from here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20MacOSX%20Binary/2013-12-30%20binary%20installer%20of%20Octave%203.8.0%20for%20OSX%2010.9.1%20%28beta%29/GNU_Octave_3.8.0-6.dmg/download).

All the files have an index at the begin of its name so you can know which one to start your study.
