# Some notes


## Semicolon

If we use the ; at the end of the line, the result will be supressed, otherwise octave will always show you the result of the commnad you just inputed.

```octave
>> a = 3
a = 3
>> A = [ 1 2; 3 4; 5 6 ]
A =

   1   2
   3   4
   5   6
>> A = [ 1 2; 3 4; 5 6 ] ;
>>
```

We also use semicolons to denote the "break line" when assigning a matrix to a variable.

## Vectors

Values on a vector are separated by spaces, same thing with matrices.`

```octave
v = [ 1 2 3 ]
v =

   1   2   3

>>
```
